-// TypeScript Spec, section 4.12.2:
-// If e is an expression of a function type that contains exactly one generic call signature and no other members,
-// and T is a function type with exactly one non - generic call signature and no other members, then any inferences
-// made for type parameters referenced by the parameters of T's call signature are fixed, and e's type is changed
-// to a function type with e's call signature instantiated in the context of T's call signature (section 3.8.5).
 var a;
 var a = bar(1, 1, g); // Should be number
 var a = baz(1, 1, g); // Should be number
